Thought process behind the development is commendable and well maintained park.

Would be better if some monitoring happens inside to control the loud shouting, unnecessary volume of music system.

Dec 2012 ,5.0,"No trip to Kolkata can be complete without experiencing the Maidan. For someone from Mumbai, it is amazing to see this vast expanse of open space in the middle of the city.

Little is a slight understatement though, as the eye takes in the vast flat plains of lush grass.Whilst there is not really anything to do here, other than observe some locals enjoying their day; cricket, farming, lounging etc. it is still a pleasant and peaceful place to visit, while away a few hours, perhaps a day even.And after the manic experiences of Kolkata, that is a much welcomed activity in itself.",Maidan

It is full of cricket, football and other obscure clubs all housed in rickety, wooden huts or pavilions. They have old colonial names such as Kolkata Referees Club, Central Excise Athletics Club, Measurers Club etc. Many games of cricket take place at all hours of the day, some more organised than others. During my stay, every flurry of activity on the cricket pitch let forth a shower of dust. The outfield may be strewn with rubbish, making it the slowest outfield ever seen. In early mornings goatherders lead flocks of goats around the area.",Maidan

All the major football (soccer) teams of the city are based out of the Maidan, as also the local cricket teams. The Maidan hosts many domestic leagues matches concurrently at the same time, such huge is the place.

This all seems a bit daft as entry is free and the guides inside are delighted to see visitors and tell them all about the family, the art, the design etc etc. If you say this is your third visit to try to see it, you have travelled especially from Delhi, you are going home tomorrow, your newly married wife will be soooo disappointed etc etc you may get in - whatever you do, keep smiling!!

Rides are ok, but seems that it will be better if they add new attraction. Few rides like the roller coaster will be better if they get cushioned sit or padded safety lock, bare steel rods as safety lock & wooden seats sometimes hurts. Washrooms are needed to be taken care of. Can not compare it with wonderla or essel world, but the best option available in Kolkata to have a fun filled weekend with the family specially if you have young kids. It also has a water park Wet-o-wild, did not visit there so unable to comment about that attraction.",Nicco Park

Feb 2016 ,5.0,"I visited the park yesterday as I didn't have any work to do at home. The last time I visited the place was long ago. So, I thought it to be a children's park initially and was in two minds at the ticket counter. But nevertheless, I bought the tickets and went in. The amount of science on display was just awesome(I visited the dynamotion and nanotechnology hall first). Each kiosk had a new concept and a new logic to explain. It really seemed like a city of science! Be it optics, physics, mechanics, space education, marine life etc. the place has it all! So, stop poring over your science books and visit the place for some real examples. But, one thing I saw is that many people just try to play with the kiosks. Don't do that. Just, have patience and understand the logic what it's trying to say.",Science City

Jan 2016 ,5.0,"Don't expect Disneyland. It costs 40 rupees to get in but is worth the extra 30 rupees to arrive on the overhead pods which are quite scary as they seem to stop in the middle for a while. Don't bother with the 3D cinema about Egypt,although quite interesting has no real 3D excitement. I enjoyed the trip to the top of the science building walking down the spiral to view the exhibits . It was very reminiscent of the old Children's section of the London Science Museum. You pay for the extras but the cost is minimal. Dinosaurs Hall was quite good but a bit tatty. The big screen extravaganza was worth queuing up for. Remember to buy your tickets at the entrance and get to the zone at least 10 minutes before the nominated time. Snacks and ice creams readily available at a sensible cost. Loads of school kids.",Science City
Oct 2015 ,5.0,This is one place where children will enjoy spending lots of time. The models of various experiments which one reads about in school are displayed on a very large scale.

Feb 2016 ,5.0,"With so much hype and great reviews, I was really expecting much more. If it wasn't for the Space Theatre I would have given it a one star rating. Ironically, The science city is stuck in the 'Evolution Park'. It's still in the Stone Age. It must have been great 10 to 15 years back, but at present it fails to impress. children are exposed to better things on TV and Internet. Half the things in the park are damaged or non functional. It's a total waste of time. Seems like it needs some funding to revive. Overall it's a badly maintained place and would not recommend a visit. And if you have to do see the space theatre as that's the only thing worth visiting.",Science City
Aug 2015,5.0,"Science City is situated at the crossing of the Eastern Metropolitian Byepass and Park Circus Connector.

The other science exhibits are ok, but there is already another museum, the Birla Industial and Technological Museum in Kolkata, so this is not unique.

I again repeat it is a must see for children and adults .,Science City
Sep 2013 ,4.0,"True to its name,its a work of science. i used to go this place a lot when I was studying for my board exams in the science stream.

Jan 2014 ,5.0,It was a pleasant experience to be at the Science city. Well conceived; scientific principles explained and reasonably well maintained. We spent only an hour which was too little.

Aug 2013 ,4.0,"If you want to teach your children that science is a lot of fun, please take them to Science City! Although a few things may appear not to be too hunky dory, yet they're sure to develop an interest in science here. But do brush-up your own knowledge to help them appreciate the place better, as the only big lacking here is the absence of knowledgeable guides. Still, worth a family outing!",Science City

To be fair, I couldn't see all of the place, as I didn't have the time for it, but from whatever I covered, I must say it was absolutely worth it. There are exhibits that teach you principles from optics, sound, musical instruments, space and time scales, biological facts, and so on. We even got to see a short 3D movie on the origins of life, with tickets priced separately. In fact the very entry to science city was exciting, by an overhead cable car that takes you to the starting museum hall. I believe the museum organizes lots of science activities like star gazing as well. Set aside a full day for this place, and you will want to come again!",Science City

The place is wonderful for kids and families. One day here is worth it. Ample parking spaces, food junctions, nice and peaceful environment.But the whole thing comes down to maintenance. The park needs to be maintained and kept clean all the time because of the thoroughfare. Especially the T-rex outside the front gate is in dire situation. I really plead the park management to make more efforts in maintaining the same as it is one of the icons of Kolkata.",Science City

After taking a city bus to East Kolkata, we had to pay for all the attractions separately, but it was okay they were cheap. There were barely any people at all, only a few children, and stray animals everywhere. It was what you would expect to see in a zombie movie. The hall of mirrors, gravity coaster, and vertigo chamber were actually pretty legit! I'd say the funniest highlight was the bicycle-powered ""monorail"" which travels over a dead garden and a shed used to store all of the park's retired fiberglass dinosaurs. It's totally ghetto but a fun place to stop before hitting up Nicco Park.",Science City
